Title:
NutriVision: AI-Powered Nutritional Analysis for Fresh and Packaged Foods
Brief Summary:
NutriVision is an innovative AI-driven solution that aims to revolutionize how consumers interact with and understand their food choices. By leveraging advanced image classification techniques, the system provides instant quality assessment of fresh produce, helping users identify rotten or spoiled fruits and vegetables. Additionally, NutriVision offers comprehensive nutritional information for both fresh produce and packaged foods, enabling users to make informed dietary decisions quickly and easily.
Problem Statement:
In today's fast-paced world, consumers face challenges in:
a) Quickly assessing the quality of fresh produce at the point of purchase or consumption 
b) Accessing accurate and comprehensive nutritional information on fresh and packaged foods
c) Making informed decisions about their food choices without relying on extensive research or expert knowledgeThese challenges often lead to poor food choices, increased food waste and difficulty maintaining a balanced diet.
High - level view of proposed solution, highlight any unique features:
We will be using datasets containing images of fresh and rotten fruits and vegetables to train a convolutional deep learning model using transfer learning which identifies if the input image is rotten or not. It also classifies it into what type of fruit or vegetable it is.(Ex:Output will be like apple or rotten apple etc.).We will then build an API to host this model which provides an interface to conduct the above task.
Technologies Used:
1.Convolutional Neural Networks
2.Transfer Learning
3.Image Processing
4.Gradio
